## Bonify RN Challenge
 This repository hosts my solutions to the React Native challenge sent by Bonify

 ## Challenge 1
 The solution to challenge one is in the folder challenge1. In this solution, I iterate my thoughts on Native Modules, it's use cases, pros and cons, you can view that [here](https://github.com/Hasstrup/bonify-challenge/tree/develop/challenge1)

 ### Challenge 2

 This is the normalizing algorithm implemented for the dataset provided in the challenge. 
 The true implementation that can be copied and pasted in the browser is located [here](https://github.com/Hasstrup/bonify-challenge/blob/develop/challenge2/src/implementation.js)
